Executing on Spring Boot :  
             
1. This is a Spring Boot application it uses a TomCat Server.
2. The port number used is 8080,so make sure that port remains free
3. Once you have opened the project,you can right click and there two was to run it: 
        . Run as Java Application
        . Run as Spring Boot App
       
  After this you can run the CRUD operations using something like Postman as shown above.     
       
  Testing:
       
   1. Diffrent types of tests were carried as shown above.
       
  what I learned from this project :
       
       In this project,I learned how to use various Java and Spring Boot functionalities ,Junit testing and being able to create a backe-end API that can perform CRUD Operations.I expected this to be quite challenging task for me.I finished this project under quick deadline. I learned many ideas from this project like how to prepare documentation for the project ,what and all included in this project like that.I used this ideas to my future projects and add more operations to that project to make better than this project.
