  what I learned from this project :
       
       In this project,I learned how to use various Java and Spring Boot functionalities ,Junit testing and being able to create a backe-end API that can perform CRUD Operations.I expected this to be quite challenging task for me.I finished this project under quick deadline. I learned many ideas from this project like how to prepare documentation for the project ,what and all included in this project like that.I used this ideas to my future projects and add more operations to that project to make better than this project.
